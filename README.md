Database synchronization using Sync Framework with WCF

Microsoft SQL Server database syncronization with WCF. Client and Server Databases Bi-Directional sync using SyncFramework.
At the Client side a small App will run which will fetch the cahnges every 10 seconds and sync with server and vice a versa.
This is Bi-directional sync and confilts will be resolve by default Server side. 
The WCF service will be deployed on the Server side which will be consume by the client app.

This application can use any client-Server distributed system where client data will be uploaded at the server end. 
It can also be used with Mobile client server to the Server for data syncronization.
